Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. they re part of your own codebase).

Any sender can withdraw Ether from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can profitably extract Ether from the contract account. Verify the business logic carefully and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unexpected loss of funds.
