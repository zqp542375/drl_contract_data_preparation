==== Integer Arithmetic Bugs ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: Crowdsale
Function name: constructor
PC address: 57
Estimated Gas Usage: 26150 - 131464
The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation.

==== Unprotected Ether Withdrawal ====
SWC ID: 105
Severity: High
Contract: Crowdsale
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 451
Estimated Gas Usage: 3427 - 38038
Any sender can withdraw Ether from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can profitably extract Ether from the contract account. Verify the business logic carefully and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unexpected loss of funds.

==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====
SWC ID: 116
Severity: Low
Contract: Crowdsale
Function name: setStatus(uint256)
PC address: 764
Estimated Gas Usage: 2776 - 2871
A control flow decision is made based on The block.timestamp environment variable.
The block.timestamp environment variable is used to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don't use any of those environment variables as sources of randomness and be aware that use of these variables introduces a certain level of trust into miners.
